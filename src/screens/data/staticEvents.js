    title: 'SILENT NIGHT',
    description: 'Sunday the 12th of February from 10.00 pm – 11.30 pm the Nidaros Cathedral will be at the disposal of the ISFiT-participants, the hosts and all others who want to join us. We are invited to make it our own sanctuary – a place for reflection, meditation, thanksgiving, prayers and acts of community. This night we can experience being silent together, listening to music, enjoying the feeling of unity and fellowship –no matter faith. All are invited to express their own faith, struggles and hopes – in a Silent Night. The Silent Night is arranged by the University Chaplaincy in Trondheim, in cooperation with ISFiT.',
