            "Each festival, ISFiT explores a new theme which in some way regards or affects students across the globe. The theme for ISFiT21 is ‘Creating Knowledge’. With this theme we want to explore challenges and opportunities related to knowledge. These are some of the questions we will ask about this theme: \r\r-What is knowledge really?\r-What implications does it have that knowledge is constructed, that the the spreading of knowledge is regulated and that we have easier access to some knowledge than others? \r-How can we as students take an active part in creating knowledge?\r\rKnowledge is all-embracing and essential, it is what we do every day and who we are. Knowledge is power- therefore we must discuss it!\r\rThematic directions: This theme is divided into six thematic directions. These directions are guidelines which narrow down the theme, as well as show how broad it can be interpreted.\r\rAcademia and educational systems: Who has access to creating, spreading and acquiring knowledge? And how can we as students create and have an active relation to knowledge?\r\rCulture and activism: How does culture create knowledge? How can culture and knowledge work as a force of change in the society, and how can different forms of activism work as a way of creating and spreading knowledge?\r\rNorms and values: How does knowledge affect what we do every day and who we are? How does knowledge shape our values, culture and norms, and how does values, culture and norms shape what knowledge we create?\r\rKnowledge as power: How does knowledge work as a tool for both empowerment and suppression, who uses it and how?\r\rMedia: What is media’s role in creating, spreading and regulating knowledge both nationally and internationally?\r\rTechnology: How can technology affect and change our access to knowledge and the knowledge being produced? And how can development of technology create both challenges and opportunities in creating, spreading and acquiring knowledge? ",

            "It all started back in 1988, when a group of students at Studentersamfundet had an idea of creating an international student festival to gather students from all over the world to create unity between students across borders. \r\rSince the very beginning, ISFiT has held a wide program of cultural events providing entertainment to both the international audience and the citizens of Trondheim. The cultural program of ISFiT consists of concerts, scene art, meetings and ceremonies. Through the cultural program, ISFiT wishes to create a venue where the participants get the opportunity to break through cultural barriers. During the festival there will also be workshops. These are smaller workgroups where participants will be discussing and sharing their views on topics related to the theme. Right before the festival kicks off in Trondheim there will be held dialogue groups where participants will meet to understand their situation and how to use dialogue as a tool. The dialogue groups have been running since 1997, and have spanned various conflicts and countries since that time.\rA year later, in 1998, the students of ISFiT began to wonder why the Nobel Peace Prize was never awarded to students. This was the beginning of the Student Peace Prize. The Student Peace Prize will be handed out during the festival, to a student or student organization that strives towards peace and understanding rather than violence.\rOver the years a number of significant people have visited the festival, including Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Dalai Lama, Chai Ling, Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, Desmond Tutu, Betty Williams and numerous others.",

            "Then we recommend taking a look at ISFiT21s Research Report! This report has been put together in order to look more closely at specific cases within the theme.\r\rThe first case focuses on academic freedom and safe spaces. It examines students’ perception of these concepts in different countries, and how political correctness is possibly affecting the knowledge that is produced in higher education and research. Creation and spreading of knowledge in higher education is at the core of the theme, and this case examines what this looks like in a global perspective.\r\rThe next case is about what conditions should be present for technology in digital platforms to be developed in a way that facilitates healthy digital behavior. This includes how digital platforms use knowledge about us, but also raising awareness, as in spreading knowledge about digital platforms. The knowledge of how these platforms work can again empower us as users.\r\rYou can also read about refugee children and their limited access to education, and especially how this affects their integration into a new school system. What implications do these differences in access to knowledge have for creating knowledge in a global perspective?\r\rLastly, we have a case that looks closer at Poland and Hungary. It is concentrated on how political leaders in these two countries use framing of knowledge to affect the population's values and attitudes about homosexuality. These political leaders have a lot of power in being able to take knowledge and present it in a certain way, and are therefore creating knowledge themselves!          ",

            "Over an unstable internet-connection late in November, I meet Özgür Gür one of the front figures in the METU LGBTI+ Solidarity. It´s only a couple of weeks since the METU LGBTI+ Solidarity was awarded with the Students Peace Prize for their brave, substantial long-term work for a diverse society, and an inclusive education for all. \r\r“We were very surprised when we got the news. In the middle of everything that’s going on, it is nice to be celebrated,” Özgür says under our conversation.\r\rAs indicated by Özgür, he and Melike – the other front person of the organization, as well as several other members of METU LGBTI+ Solidarity are facing an upcoming trial in December. The trial is the result of the pride march in 2019, where the police attacked the participants and brought 22 people into custody. To better be able to understand the circumstances and the conditions in Turkey today, Özgür tells a bit about the history of their organization. \r\r“The METU LGBTI+ Solidarity is one of the oldest LGBTI groups in Turkey, and the first university-based. But even so, it is not considered an official legal student club at the university. They have applied to the university several times but have been told that since there are no queer people at the campus, there is no need for such a student club.” \r\rEven though it is some years ago since the university stated that there were no queer people at their university, Özgür and his organization still faces several challenges. The most important being the restrictions the government introduced a few years ago. At the same time, all LGBTI-events in Turkey where banned, making it more difficult for METU LGBTI+ Solidarity to continue the important work they do. \r\r“The aim of the METU LGBTI+ Solidarity is to create a safe space for LGBTI-students, workers and the professors at the university,” Özgür elaborates. “The university has a history based on freedom movement, and in the past, freedom movements have always started at the METU.” \r\rThe organization was established in 1996 and has since then been working for a more including university. The pride march has for the last ten years, been the highlight of the year. Since the beginning, the number of participants has increased from each year and the movement has spread to new universities and cities. Özgür tells how the pride marches, especially the one in Istanbul, grew to become a colorful folk festival with more than 100.000 participants in 2014. After this however, the march – both in Istanbul and at METU – has been attached and hindered by the police. The police have tried to link the pride movement to terrorism, which Özgür and his organization got to know after the march in 2019.\r\rÖzgür tells about how he and Melike has experienced getting their house raided by armed police. They lost their scholarships after the arrest and are now facing a trial which may result in him, Melike and the other 20 members behind bars. \r\rBut even though Özgür and the organization has been faced with serious allegations, government restrictions and violent attaches, they still keep on fighting for an including university and education for all. He believes that by doing the work they do and by making people more aware of the discrimination LGBTI-people experience every day, it will open up for more discussions. And even though they have experienced a few setbacks in the latest years, the support to the organization has continued to increase over the years. \r\r“With each generation it is getting better – not perfect, but better,” Özgür sums up before we end our zoom meeting, and he is off to prepare for the upcoming trial where he is facing up to three years in prison – just because he wanted to celebrate the human right to love.",

            "From the day we are born, we are taught to ask questions and always be curious. It is said that society is driven by new knowledge and new discoveries – but is there a limit on how much knowledge one should search for? Have we reached a point where more knowledge no longer benefits society or us as individuals?\r\rTo explore these very important questions, I have spoken with Kristin Solum Steinsbekk and Trygve Brautaset, both of whom are members of the Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board. It is their job to counsel Norwegian authorities regarding bioethics and to promote debate on the ethical and societal consequences of using modern biotechnology. Both have a background in the sciences, but have engaged with questions of bioethics and social responsibility. They emphasize that, as scientists, they have a desire to discover new things and to create knowledge, but that it is important to be critical and aware of the consequences of what is discovered. “As scientists and human beings, it’s in our nature to ask questions and produce knowledge. The development can by a certain degree be controlled, but the basic curiosity is hard to stop,” Kristin says.\r\rBased on our conversation, one might conclude that the problem concerning new knowledge arises when it is no longer clear whether or not the knowledge will be good or bad for us as a society.\rMost of the technology developed today comes with both pros and cons, and there is a huge discussion these days whether or not the technology itself can be value-neutral, Kristin explained. Value-neutral in this context means that the knowledge and the technology we produce is neither good nor bad, but it all depends on the way we use it. By insisting on value-neutral technology, researchers and investors can distance themselves from taking responsibility regarding the consequences of the technology – but is this the right approach?\r\rIt used to be thought that everything should be allowed as long as it only existed on a scientific level, and regulations are only needed when it comes to the use of technology. However, this view is being challenged today, Trygve explains. For example, in 2019, a Japanese stem-cell scientist was the first to receive government support to create animal embryos containing human cells and transplant them into surrogate animals. The ultimate goal was to produce animals with organs made of human cells that could eventually be transplanted into people. However, the project came with an emergency brake: if the proportion of human DNA reaches a certain level, the project will be terminated. In this way, it was thought, the production of knowledge for which our society is not yet ready for can be stopped.\r\rIt is very likely that in the years to come, similar cases where research itself needs to be restricted will arise. This is why the Biotechnology Advisory Board tries to draw attention to the diversity of perspectives surrounding biotechnology. The board consists of members with different backgrounds, and through debates and meetings they try to give advice and guidance in dealing with bioethical issues. “The interesting thing is, during our meetings, we are presented with such a diversity of perspectives that some of us end up changing our minds. This is one of the strengths the board has,” Trygve says.\r\rThe board not only advises the Norwegian government; it is also in their mandate to address the general population and provide them with a better foundation with which to make decisions regarding ethical questions around the use of biotechnology. Kirstin explains that by having a culture of open debates in our society, and by encouraging people to get some understanding of the technology, the general population will be better prepared to make decisions when they face possibilities of new, future technologies. For instance, Kristin says, it is very likely that we all, in one way or another, will have to deal with our own genetic information. And when we do, it is important that we have the basic foundation to understand the knowledge we are given – not only what it means, but its limitations as well.\r\rWith NIPT and other tests allowing full genome sequencing, we can access and interpret data which we earlier barely knew existed. NIPT is a non-invasive test that allows pregnant women to test their fetus for the chromosomal condition trisomy and other genetic diseases with the help of a simple blood sample from the mother-to-be. It is also standard procedure today to test newborns for specific genetic conditions. In recent years, the number of conditions has increased from three to 25 in Norway, and by now there is over 3000 known diseases it is possible to test for. \rWill the information from these tests increase our quality of life, or will it cause unnecessary worries we could have gone without? Until now, in the health care setting, the policy has been to mostly test people for conditions that can be treated to help us to decide treatment options or even take preventive measures. But with a growing private market for gene-testing, and our ever-increasing knowledge and understanding of the human genome, maybe this will change. \r\rEven though new knowledge and new technology leads to new, difficult ethical issues, it could also, when used correctly, contribute to a better world. Take, for example, CRISPR technology and genetically modified organisms (GMO). New CRISPR technology enables gene editing in a much more sophisticated way, opening up the field for treatment of diseases like cancer and genetic blindness. In recent years, several Nobel prize winners have announced that they believe modern technologies, such as GMO, will be the most important tool in solving the global food-shortage issue. When it comes to the situation in Norway, Trygve explained, he is seeing a change of attitude among young politicians. Issues like the climate crisis, the development of climate-resistant plants, the desire to increase the degree of self-sufficiency in Norway, and the technologies that can contribute to these areas are getting more and more attention. There has been an interesting change in what sort of debates are being had around the world, Trygve went on to say. Previously the question in the spotlight has been: is it ethically justifiable to allow this technology? But now, a new question is being raised: is it ethically and morally justifiable not to allow this technology?\r\rBy creating knowledge, the foundation for new technologies is laid. And with new technologies, new possibilities open, which in turn can lead to new and unfamiliar problems that need to be addressed by our leaders, by our laws, by scientists and politicians, and, maybe most importantly, by you and me. So, is there a limit to how much knowledge one should produce? It is hard to imagine that the creation of knowledge will slow down any time soon, and in many areas, the technologies that produce new knowledge are already here. The possibilities are endless, but is society and the world ready for them?           ",

            "“Privacy is dead, and social media holds the smoking gun.” Those were the words Pete Cashmore, the owner of the popular platform Mashable, used to describe the state of privacy in our age. It seems plausible. The privacy we once enjoyed is gradually getting replaced by likes and shares, sending and receiving. But is this statement true, or is it a provocative exaggeration? Many people within the industry have come out in recent years and expressed their concerns with the changing nature of the notion of privacy. But do we really know the consequences of these changes?\r\rThe generation born at the turn of the millennia is the first that grew up with social media platforms as natural companions in their everyday lives. While earlier generations might have met these new developments with a healthy dose of suspicion, for today’s teenagers, apps like Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok or Facebook are taken for granted. When sharing everything on your Snapchat or Instagram story becomes a habit, from the moment you wake up until you go to bed, some part of your privacy is definitely lost. Thanks in part to this changing attitude towards social media, our privacy is slowly vanishing.\r\rWe are not the only ones responsible for the diminishing state of our privacy. Big corporations are gathering data on us, and one can never be sure what will happen to it. It can be sold, stolen, or misused. A recent example of this is the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. The company Cambridge Analytica specialized in political data-analytics and, through a leak in the system, they were able to obtain the personal data of millions of Facebook users. In 2016, Donald Trump’s election campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to specifically target users with the data that that company was able to obtain. When the general public learned of this scandal, some public trust in Facebook was lost. The hashtag #DeleteFacebook started to spread, and it led to many people actually deleting their Facebook accounts.\r\rAfter the scandal, Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, was called before Congress to answer questions about the scandal and Facebook’s privacy policies. During the hearing, Zuckerberg was confronted about Facebook’s practice of creating “shadow profiles,” profiles of users that do not use Facebook themselves. Congressman Ben Luján asked the Facebook CEO the following question: “It’s been admitted that you do collect data points on non-Facebook users, so my question is, can someone who does not have a Facebook account opt out of Facebook’s involuntary data collection?” To this, Zuckerberg answered that anyone could opt out of data collection for targeted ads, whether they use Facebook or not. Even though Zuckerberg said that he did not know what shadow-profiles were, it has been proven multiple times that Facebook is collecting data on non-users. It is true that Facebook lets one take a look at all the information they have gathered, but quite ironically, requires one to have an account to do so.\r\rThat Facebook gathers data on people that are not users is something of an unknown fact, and this just shows how deeply these companies infringe on our private information. Some of the ways Facebook gets information for their shadow-profiles are, for example, through pictures that non-users are tagged in, or when a Facebook user agrees to let Facebook find friends through their phone’s contacts. Your friends and family could unwittingly help put you at risk on social media. They leave clues about you on the internet, which companies and algorithms can pick up on and figure out who you are and what you like. This may in some way harm the notion that social media privacy is an individual choice.\r\rWith all this information about others being so easy to find, the practice of “doxing” can become quite a problem. Doxing stands for “dropping dox,” and it is used to describe when somebody is researching private or identifying data about an organization or an individual on the internet. Hackers or people who are interested in this are eager to find information people wish to keep private; things like their full name, address, or phone number. Once the desired data is obtained, it is often used to harass and shame the victims. Sometimes it can even lead to people losing their job or being humiliated in front of their friends and family. It’s no question, having one’s most personal information shared on the internet can be a scary thing.\r\rToday, 42% of the people in the world use one or several social media services. A survey conducted by Deloitte found that 90% of consumers accept legal terms and conditions without reading them. Most of us aren’t surprised anymore when ads on Facebook match up with searches we have made on Google. Since we are so used to this, we tend to forget how much of our personal information we are giving away.\r\rMost of us make mistakes every once in a while. That is just a part of life. But there is a difference between whether you can simply brush off your mistakes and move on, or if they will continue to haunt you for a long time in the virtual world. For many it has become a reality that the mistakes they made follow them, maybe for the rest of their lives. Everyone is watching and making sure you do not mess up again. One’s mistakes cease to be one’s own when the world is watching, both friends and strangers alike.\r\rSocial media is present in almost everyone’s lives. We use it to keep up with friends and family, to let people know what is going on in our lives, and to keep us updated on what is going on in the world. Social media has done good things and will probably continue to play a big role in our lives. Therefore, it is important that we know what we are agreeing to when we click ‘accept’ and what we are sharing. If you already use social media, there is a big chance that the privacy you once had is gone: a loss that cannot be easily reversed.          ",
