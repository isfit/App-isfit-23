           "It would be a shame to introduce a concept such as “polarization”. It makes us all fight over what dog breed is superior and what sitcom is worth watching again. Without any help, avoiding this is challenging, thus I have constructed this simple guide on avoiding polarization. \n\nThe guide is so simple that an anemone would be way more open-minded after following it. That is if we did support animal testing, which we do not. However, if we did forward this text to a group of sea creatures, it is my belief that the ocean would be a lot more progressive. \n\nYour preconceived opinions are reinforced when you only see things from one perspective. Given the design of a magazine it would be inconvenient to see it from anything but the front, but I suggest you give it a shot. \n\nThe second step is to find something you disagree with. Perhaps fracking isn't such a bad idea after all?\n\nSeeing as you now want to read opinions that contradict your values, I will assume that you would be more interested in a guide on becoming polarized, lucky for you that is just what this article has become\n\nAnd it is not a simple guide. It is so not simple that when tested on anemones none of them changed their behaviour after reading it. \n\nThe first step to becoming more polarized is to read a paragraph and only seek the information you want to believe. Let’s give it a shot. \n\nTo disagree with each other is to accept that every person has integral values, yet some act as if they must convince you of what they see is the only acceptable truth. Where does the balance of truth and opinion go? Those who simply accept facts without questioning them are defined as narrow minded, and we have been taught to seek the contrary. Is it ideal to walk around with opinions which one half-heartedly believes in? To be open minded does not equal being weak of will, every person must know that their values are worth believing in, otherwise there would not be any point in acting to them. In conclusion one should take pride in one’s beliefs, but not hesitate if conditions change and you are suddenly struck with the thought, “What the hell was I thinking?”\n\nIf you are a polarized person what you should conclude from that paragraph is:\n- Every person has a right to their opinion and an attempt at challenging it should be regarded as an attack on who you are as a person.\n- You should do everything in your power to convince people that your truth is the only truth.\n\nAnd you should ignore these points:\n- Being open-minded is not the same as not trusting your values.\n- You can be faithful to your opinion, whilst still capable of letting go of it if it does not correspond with your current values.\n\nIf you find yourself unable to ignore the latter, it might be that you still are not radicalized to the level we are aiming for. This concerns me, however with dedication, even the most tolerant of people can become close minded.\n\nTo be more close-minded you can:\n- Find statues, pieces of art, benches etc that are dedicated to historical figures you dislike. Express this dislike by photoshopping this subject out of pictures people have posted on Google Maps\n- Make it a goal to state broad and vague accusations against people you do not support three times a day\n- Make it your duty to share new stories that only your source has the guts to release to the public.\n\nI hope this article has given you a new perspective on polarization. If you feel more polarized, great! If you feel less polarized, that is great too. Just know that nothing is set in stone and that it is never too late to change your mind on a matter.",

            "It all started back in 1988, when a group of students at Studentersamfundet had an idea of creating an international student festival to gather students from all over the world to create unity between students across borders. \n\nSince the very beginning, ISFiT has held a wide program of cultural events providing entertainment to both the international audience and the citizens of Trondheim. The cultural program of ISFiT consists of concerts, scene art, meetings and ceremonies. Through the cultural program, ISFiT wishes to create a venue where the participants get the opportunity to break through cultural barriers. During the festival there will also be workshops. These are smaller workgroups where participants will be discussing and sharing their views on topics related to the theme. Right before the festival kicks off in Trondheim there will be held dialogue groups where participants will meet to understand their situation and how to use dialogue as a tool. The dialogue groups have been running since 1997, and have spanned various conflicts and countries since that time.\n\nA year later, in 1998, the students of ISFiT began to wonder why the Nobel Peace Prize was never awarded to students. This was the beginning of the Student Peace Prize. The Student Peace Prize will be handed out during the festival, to a student or student organization that strives towards peace and understanding rather than violence.\n\nOver the years a number of significant people have visited the festival, including Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Dalai Lama, Chai Ling, Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, Desmond Tutu, Betty Williams and numerous others.",

            "Doxa Magazine was founded in 2017 by students at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Because of their work promoting freedom of speech as well as press freedom, they received the Student Peace Prize in 2023, a price awarded on behalf of all students in Norway. We had the chance to talk with Ekaterina Martynova, a journalist from Doxa Magazine about some of the challenges they face, as an independent magazine, working in Russia. \n\n“The idea of the magazine was to make a platform where students and academics could provide their opinions on the ongoing discussions of political and social Institutions in Russia, both inside and outside academia. So for us it was important firstly to give the voice to young people where they could be heard by others in academia.”, Ekaterina tells us. Doxa Magazine covers topics such as social inequality, harassment, corruption in the universities, as well as political corruption.\n\nThe Magazine started out focusing on student rights and the academic crisis in Russia. Gradually, as the audience expanded and the magazine became bigger, it started covering more global news and topics such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, war crimes and political repression in Russia. Martynova explains the reason behind some of their success. “...before DOXA there was no media or student organizations in Russia which could provide this platform for politically active young voices, so it was a completely free space and there was a huge demand among students for this.” That said, the road has not been an easy one, and they have faced both resistance, and expulsion. “In 2019 one of the biggest protests happened in Moscow, and most of the participants were students and professors, who got arrested. Later we helped them fundraise money for the finds and provide them lawyers, and just wrote news about them.”\n\nFacing resistance from the government\n\nThe Peace Prize committee states that “Despite threats and persecution, the magazine works in a network of editors living in exile, local informants and anonymous journalists - all students or recent graduates. The way they are working shows how the Russian opposition can continue to operate within extremely challenging conditions. DOXA`s work highlights the importance of not cutting ties with critical actors living under an authoritarian regime. They need to know that their resistance is recognized, which will be crucial for the rebuilding of a free and democratic society in the future. … The way they work shows how the Russian opposition can continue to operate within extremely challenging conditions. DOXA's work highlights the importance of not cutting ties with critical actors living under an authoritarian regime. They need to know that their resistance is recognized, which will be crucial for the rebuilding of a free and democratic society in the future”.\n\nWe asked Martynova about some of the biggest challenges they face. “We experience a lot of resistance. It started a year ago with the criminal case that the Russian government made against four of our editors who put a video where they stated that it's unlawful to fret students that want to og and the protests and so on. Later they were raided and put under house arrest for a year.” Martynova  explained that the court later decided to sentence the students to four years of corrective labor, giving them no choice but to leave the country if they wanted to continue their work. In desember 2019, they were expelled from the higher school of economics student organization;\n\n“It was the beginning of our resistance to governmental institutions in Russia.  Now with the start of the war we were blocked inside of the country. Today we got the news that one of the government commissions who commended DOXA to be categorized as extremist organization, because of our content that we are publishing they especially mentioned that we are talking about the work crimes we are financed from the west, and in case we will be recognized as an extremist organization in Russia, that will be a huge problem, which puts you in a very complicated position if you are working inside the country. Your bank account is frozen, there is a criminal risk of being put in jail for 5 -10 years.”\n\nIn the press statement, the Students Peace Prize committee justified giving the 2022 prize to DOXA, saying   “The Russian state has been more and more hostile against critical voices inside the country. Protests have been shut down, dozens of thousands have been arrested for raising their voices and human rights organizations have been  stamped as foreign agents towards others in opposition to Kreml. When members of DOXA supported students participating in the opposition protests in 2019, they got expelled from the university, and four of the establishments experienced home invasion, physical violence and house arrest. Shortly said; they got numerous of their basic civil rights denied. DOXA is today in the first line for a free independent media, and the rights to express themselves in Russia.”\n\n“Winning the prize is a big honor”\n\nMartynova says winning this prize means a lot to DOXA Magazine. “The prize is a big honor and a big appreciation of the work we have done… Its the first prize that we are getting as a Russian organization, and its a very big event for us, in the sense of our work being recognized”. She tells us further that they are very grateful to all Norwegian students who have shown their support, that it shows that their work isn't in vain, and that it is not just something Russian students care about. “It also means that the global community cares about human rights, and general democratic values in authoritarian countries. I think it’s a very huge step toward supporting journalists and activists in exile, especially young ones like us”.\n\nLastly, they emphasize how their work could not be possible without other independent media, for instance in Belarus and Ukraine. “...we stand in solidarity with those organizations, students unions, magazines and media, who worked with Russian propaganda, and Russian crimes.”\n\nTo continue their work, as well as reach an audience outside of Russia, Martynova tells us how much following DOXA on social media, as well as donating money to pay the reporters, helps. “We are going to establish English versions soon, and we would be very, very grateful if you follows us.”",

            "Society presupposes human contact and cooperation. Throughout life, from start to finish, interaction with other people is something one must deal with. However, how the individual interacts and thrives with other people varies quite significantly. The personality traits introversion and extroversion describe the differences between individuals regarding how we tend to act and think in social settings. Said differences can affect our lives in terms of how we choose to solve challenges, the way we communicate, which friends we choose and how we show affection. They also can have an impact on our career choices, and to what extent one is successful or not in various aspects of life. In the book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Caine, this topic is problematized.\n\nSome people feel energized by interacting with other people. These people are often referred to as extroverts. A typical extroverted person thrives on being the center of attention and is more than happy to “take the floor” in social settings. An introvert, however, is often explained as the polar opposite of an extrovert. A classic introvert recharges their batteries by spending time by themselves. This person often has a louder inner dialogue than an outer one and is often perceived as more reserved because of it. It is, however, to be mistaken for shyness, which has no direct correlation with introversion. Shyness is a result of fear of social condemnation.\n\nAlthough people tend to identify as either one or the other, the classification of personality traits is not necessarily that rigid. On a scale where being either introverted or extroverted represent the extremes, most of us find ourselves somewhere in between on said scale. According to some psychologists, there is a strong correlation between a person’s DNA and to what extent they have introverted or extroverted traits.\n\nBeing extroverted is a personality trait that has been found to be less prevalent in countries in Asia and Africa than, for example, in Europe and America. This is claimed to be related to the fact that the people who emigrated in earlier times and people who had an urge to explore were often those with extroverted personality traits. Evolution has also contributed to the fact that this has become a more common personality trait predominantly found in the Western world, contrary to the rest of the world.\n\nIt is assumed that approximately one out of three people in the Western world are introverts. Despite the fact that we naturally have different personalities and needs, society is in many ways more adapted to the typical extrovert, rather than the introvert. Susan Caine writes about the rise of “the extrovert ideal”, which during the 20th century has left deep traces in our cultural world. The extroverted ideal refers to the fact that being a person with extroverted personality traits is perceived as the ideal in Western culture. The extrovert ideal can clearly be identified in various social studies. These studies show that a person who talks a lot and who typically is the center of attention are considered smarter, prettier and more interesting. In connection with this, these people are often preferred in relationships. In addition, studies have shown that thoughts and ideas that extroverts present in a group context are higher valued than others. This even though others may have presented equally good input in the given context.\n\nIn a professional setting, being extroverted is often considered attractive, and where extroverts are often rewarded with advantages and/or benefits. Being an open, outgoing and typically talkative person will in many contexts be traits that employers consider favorable. This becomes apparent in various recruitment processes and job advertisement. In job It is not uncommon for advertisements to include that the employers are looking for an “outgoing” person. When this is the typical phrasing, it may seem as if everyone should be outgoing, when that in fact is not the case. Choosing candidates based on charisma and radiance, as well as the ability to capture an audience, can contribute to excluding those who could have been excellent candidates for a job, but don’t identify with the phrasing in the advertisement. In addition to it often being easier to get a job as a typical extrovert, introverts frequently experience less recognition from their boss in a workplace, as well as less overall job satisfaction, this is enlightened through European Employee Index by HR Norway.\n\nIn addition to professional life often being more suited for extroverts, the same research shows that extroverts to a greater extent take on leadership roles than introverts. Can we therefore conclude that extroverted people make better leaders? (Probably not). Introverts have a list of traits which often corresponds with the traits of a competent leader. A typical introvert often possesses qualities such as deep thinking and reflection, radiates a sense of calm, is often a skilled problem solver and possesses creative abilities. In addition, an introvert is often a good listener and person who has less of a need to assert oneself within a group, which again makes room for others to establish themselves within a collective.\n\nConsidering the question of which personality traits make for the better leader, there is no definitive answer. Different types of leaders are suited for different fields of work and different working groups. Just as a workplace needs different types of leaders and coworkers with different qualifications, a society needs people with different personality traits, resources and abilities. We need a wide range of competence to achieve both smaller and greater achievements. We need a person who is able to provide a room with lots of energy, who loves to talk and to socialize. As such we also need a person who is analytical and able to reflect, a good listener who does not need to be the center of attention.\n\nSociety’s favoring of people with extroverted personality traits is unfortunate for several reasons. According to Caine, this has meant that in many contexts we tend to strongly underestimate introverts, and that we miss out on important resources in society. As the traits of an extrovert is considered as the ideal it affects how many introverts value themselves and their own capabilities. We must together start to build up under the qualities of the individual, and embrace the differences in personalities. It is important that we break down the norm of the extrovert ideal and start valuing diversity. As individuals we have the possibility to excel in our own fields, but it is together that we are able to achieve mighty things.  ",

            "The fact that war and conflict bring about a significant higher risk for gender-based violence and sexual rape, is neither a new nor unknown phenomenon. There are countless examples from both a historical and global point of view. Women are often the victims. This problem is also big in the Ukraine-war nowadays; The United Nations have denounced this war in particular as a crisis for girls and women. They have also described how sexual harassment, torture and rape are used as weapons, and how women as refugees are vulnerable to human trafficking. The consequences are enormous for the victims.\n\nWhy do armed conflicts lead to a significant increase in violence and abuse against women? How can we best care for those who are exposed to this, and is there anything we can do to prevent such violence? Or must we accept this as a sad, but unavoidable consequence of war and conflict?\n\nGender roles in war\n\nWar and conflict often induce men and women to take on different roles. Men are often sent directly to the battlefront and are implicated in military operations, which could lead to serious physical and mental illness and death. Even if women traditionally have been less involved in direct combat, being a woman in a war situation puts you in significant risk. Women and girls are therefore often seen as an especially vulnerable group.\n\nProfessor emeritus and psychologist Nora Sveaass, with extensive clinical experience from working with traumatized refugees, describes how women in war often will experience major changes in roles and responsibilities. In addition to the roles they already hold, they must often take over their husbands' roles as well. Many of them will therefore be left with a double burden of care and work, in addition to the fear and dread for the family's financial and security situation\n\nGender based violence and rape\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) describes gendered violence as “sexual, physical, mental and economic harm inflicted in public or in private… includes threats of violence, coercion and manipulation. This can take many forms such as intimate partner violence, sexual violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation and so-called ‘honour crimes”, and at the same time as “one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world today”.\n\nWhile as many as one out of three women worldwide experience sexual or physical gender-based violence, various crisis contribute to a significantly higher risk. Associate Professor at the Center for Gender Research at the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies of Culture, NTNU, Jennifer Branlat, points out that the problem also concerns men, boys and non-binary people, particularly in detention and captivity situations. She also draws attention to the fact that “Vulnerable groups often become the targets of campaigns that encourage violent practices as a weapon of war. This is connected to a dangerous mentality that male soldiers are somehow entitled to conquer through practices like rape, mutilation, torture and forced marriage”.\n\nSveaass goes on to explain how the wars in the Balkans in the 90s have been a contributing factor to why the UN has since had the safety and rights of women and girls high on the agenda; it was only in connection to the war in the Balkans that the world really opened its eyes to the fact that it was a matter of systematic abuse against women, and that this also formed a strategic part of warfare. After this, the UN has implemented several important resolutions and initiated important work. Gender-based violence is now seen as a weapon of war that can threaten humanity in the same way as other weapons.\n\nSerious consequences for the victims\n\nSveaass says that many of the women experience major consequences after being subjected to abuse in war situations. She says that some of the victims are ashamed of what they have been through, and could also experience a very changed relationship with their own body; “It is the most intimate aspects of life and body that have been attacked, and one has been humiliated in the grossest way. Such words and actions will often linger for many years; -voices and expressions that were used can still be heard, the body aches because the abuse continues to affect them.”\n\nAt the same time, she explains how trauma, re-experiences and nightmares are frequently seen. This could be very inhibiting in daily life, and lead to social withdrawal. This may come from a desire to avoid things that could be a reminder of the event or be perceived as triggers, but also from a fear that others will “disclose” what they have been through.\n\nAccording to Sveaass, some people feel ashamed of having to seek help or not mastering caring roles as well as they did before the violence and rape. At the same time, there are many who experience ostracism and stigma, and may therefore want to hide or isolate themselves. The distrust of others is often very great.\n\nHow could gender-based violence in wartime be avoided and handled?\n\nSveaass describes the abuse women and girls experience as extremely gross, and as a serious human rights violation, where the violation of the person, both psychologically and physically, is a goal itself. She further describes how many of the victims are left with a feeling of being unprotected and almost completely disenfranchised in the situations; many feel that no one has intervened either during the events or afterwards.\n\nShe therefore sees it as very important that those who are exposed to such abuse should receive compensation and rehabilitation, and that society very clearly distances itself from these abuses and punishes those responsible. At the same time, she sees training of the military, holding leaders accountable and bringing them to justice, making the crimes visible and intensifying the work to prevent them from happening again, as central tasks for the world community and its leaders.\n\nBranlat says “Gender-based violence in times of conflict should not be seen as an unavoidable consequence of war. It can be avoided, and there are many pathways to this, but it involves the parties involved in the conflict allowing international organizations and Non-Governmental Organization`s access to vulnerable groups with aims to provide protection. It also involves recognizing that basic human rights are at stake”.\n\nUN Women mentions women being involved in “decision-making platforms on de-escalation, conflict prevention, mitigation and other processes in pursuit of peace and security” as an important tool to provide peace and security for women in areas of conflict.",

            "Cambridge Dictionary defines the word polarization as “the act of dividing something, especially something that contains different people or opinions, into two completely opposing groups». Polarization between people with seemingly contradicting opinions and attitudes can be seen “everywhere”, in both a bigger and smaller scale. Politics and ethnic conflicts are greater examples, but it exists in everyday life too.\n\nWhy do people group themselves in ways that create conflict and why do we misunderstand each other so often? Why do these deviations between people usually seem so incompatible, and could we as individuals try to avoid this? And what is the potential advantage of freeing ourselves from the “us-against-them” mentally, typically seen in strong groups?\n\nThe importance of groups\n\nIn- and out-groups are concepts from sociology and social-psychology used to describe how group belonging could affect our attitudes and thinking, and why group members often act similarly.\n\nAs social beings, group belonging could seem central for human wellbeing, and is important for most of us. We all belong to different groups; it could be defined by interests, political stance, geographical affiliation, family or your working field. Groups like these could all participate in creating a feeling of personal value, belonging and being appreciated by others - something seen as important for preventing mental health issues and loneliness.\n\nGroupthink as a polarization factor\n\nAt the same time, the collective group thinking that often occurs in these groups, could aid in creating distance and negative attitudes against out-group members, those we do not see as members of our in-group.\n\nAccording to social psychology, we tend to make collective thoughts and beliefs within groups, which we think all in-group members have in common. This is not always the case, since there are many different processes affecting how collective “groupthink” is made.\n\nAs we want to fit into the group and preserve a good atmosphere, we tend to seek common agreement with other group members. This is something that could lead to individuals withholding thoughts seen as conflicting with the group, and the views that are being shared will often stand unchallenged. We also tend to verify the opinions that are presented, something that could enhance the stands further.\n\nResearch has shown that something which might seem as the group members’ collective thoughts, often seem more extreme and unambiguous than each member's separate thoughts. This could lead to group polarization, where subgroups develop more extreme attitudes where everyone seems to agree. These attitudes are often directed towards out-group members.\n\nGroup belonging can make us feel safe and is something we want to be a part of. Not blindly following the group may therefore seem a bit difficult, as you could fear losing your place in the group and possibly be seen as an out-group member. The membership could also lead to deindividualization, where people can minimize their own role and the importance of their behaviour and stances, due to the greater group.\n\nHow to prevent groupthink and preserve a wider perspective\n\nThe fact is that we all could be affected by groupthink in one way or another. Sometimes it can affect us negatively by adopting prejudice and less positive mindsets, or preventing us from getting to know and explore new people and situations. This can further lead to conflicts and polarization between people we see as out-group members.\n\nThese processes often happen automatically and unconsciously. What can you do to prevent this, and instead be able to form your beliefs based on your own experiences and exploration of the world? And what could be the potential gain from freeing ourselves from group conformity?\n\nHere are some thoughts of what you could do to gain a better understanding of other people:\n\n1. Be open and curious: If you encounter people or situations who are unfamiliar, where you may feel a bit insecure or have trouble with understanding others’ point of view, try to understand and leave your prejudices behind. By meeting new people with a more open and curious mind, and by showing interest in them, it is easier to reach out to and learn more from them.\n2. Ask yourself why you act and think the way you do, especially when it comes to thoughts and assumptions about others. Are they based on personal experiences or just blindly learnt from someone else?\n3. Think about who you are surrounding yourself with. Are you only surrounded by people who are very similar to yourself, who think just like you and who have the same interests and manners as yourself? Or do you surround yourself with different people who can teach you something new, who may have different interests and experiences than yourself, and who give you a greater perspective and new thoughts?\n4. Be humble and do not think that you yourself have all the answers. Your opinions and attitudes are based on your experiences, personality and influence from your surroundings, and your foundation will therefore be limited to this. Understand that this can be a limitation to how you understand and perceive things, and that others may have different ideas or perceptions that may be just as correct as the ones you have -it is just based on other things.\n\nWhat are the potential gains of a more open view?\n\nWhile being open, curious and thirsty for new experiences and meeting new people, you could learn and earn much insight and understanding about something you did not know a lot about earlier. This experience-based understanding could tell you a lot about why the society, our surroundings and other people are functioning the way they do.\n\nOpenness for new experiences and ways of thinking could also help you create new ideas and give you a more diverse and rich life. The outcome could potentially be new acquaintances, new interest and personal growth through a broader perspective of the society. It could also lead to less conflicts and getting along better with your surroundings.\n\nThis being said; the previous writing does not mean that you should accept everything other people are saying or doing if it goes against your own values, but it could give you a better understanding of why things and people are acting in the way they do. At the same time, a broader understanding of the reasons behind other people’s attitudes and acts could be helpful if you want to work for a more equal world. The perspective could be a good starter for reaching out to people in a better and more effective way, as conflicts and rigid standoffs often tend to inhibit good communication and cooperation.",

            "‘Cancel that bitch like Nino’ Lil Wayne sings in his 2009 hit I’m Single. He’s referring to the 1991 cult classic New Jack City where Nino Brown, the main character, pours champagne over his girlfriend saying “Cancel that bitch, I’ll get another one tomorrow”. In a Vox article, Aja Romano tracks down this specific line as one of the first references in popular culture to ‘cancelling someone’. Today the word cancel is so overused that even reading about it makes you weary. In the age of social media, online discourse and wokeness, cancel culture has become one of the major antagonists of the 21st century. Our perception of right and wrong is constantly changing, and we increasingly are expecting accountability and responsibility for peoples' actions, both current and previous. Reduced to a simple question of right or wrong, the current debate lacks nuance. It has become an ongoing battle between the online activists, and those who deem them ‘the morality police’. Considering that many view cancel culture as a way to protect marginalised groups from discrimination and hatred, it is important to question whether it serves that purpose or not.\n\nPublic shaming has existed since the beginning of time. In the Bible, Adam and Eve were exiled from the garden of Eden after eating the forbidden fruit and forced to live a life of shame. In ancient Greece, democratic Athens actively used the political process of ostracism, where citizens could be exiled for ten years if they were considered a threat to democracy. During the Middle Ages, public humiliation was used to punish men and women for their sins, their unlawfulness, their crimes and, of course, their blasphemy. Moral failure was to be punished publicly. This punishment played an important role as it deterred others from deviating from social rules and moral standards. Of course, we should be careful when comparing the consequences of breaking the law in the Middle Ages with modern society’s reactions to perceived wrongdoings, but the purpose of cancel culture holds the same implications: moral failure will result in public humiliation.\n\nSome might say that cancel culture represents a tyranny of the majority. In John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty, he describes this phenomenon as the silencing of the minority by a tyrant or an oppressor. The topic of censorship has been raised many times in the debate, often by people claiming that freedom of speech is being endangered. It is important to point out the difference between hate speech, and speech we do not like, that challenges our perception of the world or might be controversial. The line between these two is not always easily agreed upon. And if you cross the line, what should the consequences be?\n\nSome have questioned the existence of cancel culture. Is someone being cancelled or are they just facing the consequences of their actions? From this perspective we can view cancelling as someone being boycotted. It is a way of saying “We don’t agree with you, and therefore we won’t continue to support you through your art, medium, music, etc…”. With this perspective, cancel culture is merely about accountability. But how does this actually play out?\n\nCancel culture is neither a political movement nor representative of a specific ideology. Despite its association with the political left, it is found on all sides of the political spectrum. In a speech from 2020, Trump described cancel culture as “the very definition of totalitarianism”, despite having been an active participant of it himself. As the following quote from his Twitter account demonstrates when he demanded that CNN analyst Joe Lockhart be fired for speculating that Trump was hiding a stroke from the American public: “Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act. When the World watches CNN, it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!”. Ironically, it is often the people complaining the loudest about cancel culture that insist on cancelling opinions they do not like.\n\nThis is especially evident with the rise of antifeminism and the popularity of misogynistic creators. A kind of anti-cancel culture movement is growing, and the #metoo-backlash seems to have reached its peak. In the defamation trial of Amber Heard and Johnny Depp the frustration and anger with cancel culture and #metoo was blatant, and not in a good way. The very public domestic violence lawsuit became a media circus, with Depp generally receiving positive attention and even admiration, whilst Heard was relentlessly bullied online. You cannot help but feel a bitter aftertaste. Mainstream media’s portrayal of Depp and Heard was unnuanced and failed to acknowledge how sexism and misogyny played an important role in Heard’s cancellation. This portrayal of Heard as a manipulative, lying woman could make other women fearful of coming forward with their stories of abuse.\n\nMore controversial voices may feel silenced by cancel culture and its moral implications. There is a danger that if people feel their freedom of speech is curtailed then anger and frustration can result in more hateful and discriminating behaviour. This is not only seen in the backlash against #metoo, but also in the #alllivesmatter reaction the #blacklivesmatter-movement. Even though social media creates a platform for marginalized voices to speak up, it seems their opponents speak louder. Progressive voices risk being called radical, and accused of taking it ‘too far’, when speaking up against bigotry and discrimination.\n\nThere is no easy answer to whether cancel culture works in our favor or not. As we move towards a more and more digitalized world, the distinction between the public and the private sphere is disappearing. As future generations grow up, it’s not easy to say whether social media will continue connecting us or divide us even more.",

            "Have you ever walked through a neighborhood and thought, “This is….ugly”. or “This building makes me depressed”.  I have at least had these thoughts, more times than I can count on my hand. We, as humans , are affected by our environment. Throughout history, people have laid great emphasis on the places they inhabit. Look at the old stone houses filling up the streets in France, Italy or Spain. Or the preserved houses built in trees that serve as tourist attractions all over Scandinavia. Who also serve as important symbols of the country's cultural heritage. Even in old Egypt, hundreds of hours were spent building giant, triangular structures of stone, much for the reason of aesthetics.\n\nA Norwegian movement called “The architectural revolt”, have gained rising attention. The revolt criticizes modern architecture. Modern architecture has dominated much of Norway’s architectural culture since the 1920’s, which the architectural revolt is not happy with. The movement simply thinks too many ugly buildings are built today. Monotone, simple, square buildings are something the movement finds dreadful. @Aonorge, is an Instagram profile, that has reached 68 000 followers, which loudly advocates for the need of more aesthetically pleasing buildings. Showing that the movement has gained quite a lot of supporters.\n\nThe new Munch Museum in Oslo is a building that is heavily disapproved of by the  movement The museum is supposed to honor the famous artist Edvard Munch as it displays his many artworks. The building is, simply said, a large crooked square block. It is, no doubt, an expression of modern architecture.  Nevertheless, it received the “Horror-medallion” from the architectural revolt, and was said to be one of Norway’s ugliest buildings.  To quote Psychologist Sahar Soururi, who is active in the architectural revolt “The Munch museum is so ugly that it awakens emotional discomfort”\n\nNevertheless, it can be pointed out that the residential areas that are built today is made with an intention to lower the housing prices. For many, it is difficult to enter the housing market, and traditional architecture is very sought after, and can therefore be expensive. For example, the most expensive streets to live on in Oslo, like “Oscars Gate” or “Jacobs alles gate” is defined by beautifully structured traditional architecture. One of the intentions of modernism, is to build simple, quick, and easy buildings. The modernist and functionalist architectural movement grew in the 1920’s, and reflected the growing need of residential areas for the working class. The movement reflected the needs of ordinary people; a functional living area close to work. Is the architectural revolt, in this regard, a privileged movement driven by an elite that can afford to care about such matters? Functionalism, no matter how ugly it is, covers the need for housing.\n\nAesthetics is important for the population. To inhabit places with depressing architecture, can entail negative psychological consequences, in regard that people value the places we live in. Fewer traditional buildings are built today, which is a shame, considering their contribution to the environment around us, and their cultural heritage. However, modernism has its benefits, which the architectural revolt seems to gloss over. What is certain, is that we value traditional architecture, and it should be emphasized to build traditional architecture, as well as modern.",

            "A warming planet waits for no one. Floods, droughts, extreme weather, hunger, and animal extinction are just some of the warnings in the latest report from IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Christened the “file of shame” by UN Secretary-General himself, António Guterres, the report shines light on the seriousness of the situation. One thing is specifically evident: the consequences of climate change are not experienced equally. Europe and North America together are responsible for almost forty percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Meanwhile, Africa is only responsible for seven percent, and the Middle East even less – only two. It is, however, countries in Africa and the Middle East that experience the brunt of climate change. Both vulnerability and capacity to adapt to climate change plays an important role. In nations with weak political systems, infrastructures, and political institutions, as well as a high level of poverty, climate change may increase security risks and violent conflict. To explore this topic more, I reached out to Junior Research Fellow at NUPI, Anne Funnemark.\n\nAnne Funnemark is a part of the Climate-related Peace and Security Risks project, a collaboration between The Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIRPI). On their website, NUPI writes that throughout the project, they wish to “generate reliable, relevant, timely and actionable information on climate, peace and security risks”. On top of that, they want to build a global network of scientists and decision makers, and establish a Nordic and Baltic Climate, Peace and Security Network.\n\nIn recent years there has been a lot of research on the correlation between climate change and conflict. Questions on whether the correlation exists, and if so, to what degree, has been raised. Therefore, it is important to note that the causal correlation between climate change and violent conflict is yet to be proved. With that in mind, I asked Funnemark if climate change still affects conflict indirectly or can do so through other channels. “The impacts of climate change can contribute to magnifying existing socio-economic stresses, thereby contributing to added stress on human security. This depends very much on the context in which we are looking, and in some circumstances, this added stress on human security can increase the risk of violent conflict.”, Funnemark explains. She also points out four pathways that can be used to navigate the relationship between climate change and conflict: livelihood deterioration, migration and mobility, tactics of military and armed actors, and lastly, elite exploitation and mismanagement. In Sahel, a region in Africa, the changing climate is putting pressure on the livelihoods of both nomadic and transhumant pastoralists. Scarce access to water and grazing land are leading to violent conflicts between the farmers and the pastoralists in some places. Funnemark points out this as an example of how deterioration of livelihood opportunities and changing access to resources can escalate conflict.\n\nThe Climate-related Peace and Security Risks project focuses on the relationship between climate change and security risks in several countries. One of those is Iraq. I asked Funnemark why Iraq is more vulnerable to climate change than other countries. “Iraq is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its physical exposure. Mean annual temperatures are likely to increase by 2 °C by 2050, in particular negatively affecting water security and increasing the likelihood of more frequent and more severe droughts and dust storms. Iraq is also projected to experience a decline in rainfall, which will also negatively affect water security and food security.” Adaptation capacity to climate change is also affected by socio-economic vulnerabilities, such as high levels of poverty, political instability, violent conflict, and corruption. Funnemark points out how this can become a vicious downward spiral: “Iraq’s long-standing violent conflict is especially important when explaining its high levels of vulnerability to climate change. Armed conflict has profound socioeconomic implications, increasing poverty, reducing the function of the state and damaging the economy. In so doing, armed conflict makes countries and societies more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and increases the risk of climate-related conflict in what has the potential to become a vicious downward spiral.”\n\nThe climate crisis can also be exploited by armed groups. “What we do see in Iraq is that armed groups have, in several instances, taken control of and destroyed water sources and infrastructure. The significance of such control and destruction increases as water becomes scarcer due to the impacts of climate change.” She also points to the situation in the Philippines and Afghanistan, where extreme weather is a significant factor in recruitment to paramilitary groups. When the local population consider the government inadequate to the task of dealing with the problems presented by climate change, illegal paramilitaries present an attractive alternative.\n\nClimate change also disproportionately impacts women due to pre-existing gender roles and inequalities. In Iraq this is especially evident, as the country ranks number 154 out of 156 in the Global Gender Gap report. “Oxfam reports that women in Iraq are highly marginalized, with very limited access to social, political and economic life. Access is hindered both by cultural and social norms and by institutional and legal barriers, and women and girls are often constrained to traditional reproductive roles”, Funnemark elaborates. Men therefore adapt easier to climate change, and Funnemark points out that women are often constrained by their caretaking responsibilities: “[In] Iraq, we see that whilst men tend to migrate to cities when livelihoods deteriorate, women tend to stay behind to take care of family and livestock.” Because of the traditional responsibilities of women in Iraq, such as growing and gathering food, climate change impacts their access to these resources. Funnemark also tells me about how the Hawzi marshes in Iraq are affected by drought and water scarcity. Women are forced to search further to provide livestock for the family, and their workload is increased.\n\n“While we can assess the links between climate change and the tactics and military and armed actors, we cannot, as researchers, predict the future”, Funnemark tells me. Even though we cannot predict the future, our current inaction is causing more harm than we know. Iraq, among many other countries, is facing the harsh consequences of climate change and emissions they themselves are not responsible for. People’s livestock and livelihood are affected immensely. One may ask whether conflict and security risk will escalate in the future if global temperatures keep rising and the action gap expands.",

            "ISFiT23 President - Åse Håtveit\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself?\n\nYes, I can! My name is Åse, and I am 24 years old. Now I'm working on a master degree in computer science, and this is my fifth year as a student in Trondheim. I grew up in Oslo with two younger siblings, and have always been that kid who loved to have a lot to do all the time. I have a passion for music, and spent most of my free time playing the clarinet and saxophone in music ensembles and bands over the years. Playing music was my introduction to different cultures and people, and I learned that even though you may have different backgrounds, religious beliefs, or political opinions, you can find a common ground in music.\n\nWhat was the idea behind polarization?\n\nThe idea behind Polarization came from a conversation with a friend that was very frustrated about the fact that the world was so divided, and that all the debates only asked for yes or no, or right or wrong. After the conversation, the word “polarization” was stuck to my mind, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense that this was the heart of ISFiT - getting people to tear down the wall and boundaries, find a common ground, and build friendship and dialogue based on that trust. Polarization isn't just some political debate in the US, but a global issue more than capable of rocking the most solid democratic pillars of the world. ISFiT is the perfect platform to open a dialogue and make a change.\n\nHow has it been planning ISFiT post pandemic\n\nWell, honestly it has been a privilege to work with so many amazing volunteers, that's the first thing that pops into my head. Even though ISFiT21 was a digital festival, creating ISFiT23 has been an amazing opportunity to create something of our own. Yes, I admit it has been challenging to create a festival that almost none of our volunteers have experienced before, myself included. But what I experience is that even though none of us actually have experienced this before, the importance of ISFiT and why we have this festival stays stronger than ever. Pandemic, war, climate changes and poverty - without learning how to understand and cooperate with each other, we are not able to solve the problems that the world is facing today. ISFiT is now more important than ever.\n\nWhat are your goals for ISFiT23\n\nFor me it's very important that ISFiT23 re-introduces an amazing and important festival that is created for students, by students. ISFiT is a place to connect students in Trondheim and the rest of the world, and to set the agenda on global issues that matter.\n\n\nISFiT23 Vice President - Lars Ingar Tutturen\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about yourself?\n\nOf course! My name is Lars Ingar, and I’m a 22 year old man from Norway. Currently I’m studying energy and environmental engineering here in Trondheim, and I’ve studied here since 2020. I grew up in Ås, a small town just south of Oslo, alongside my three brothers. I’ve always liked to do a lot of different things in my free time - such as playing volleyball, the piano, singing or being politically engaged. I also have a deep fascination with the world around us - be it the nature on Earth or the people that inhabit it. For the last two years of high school, I went to an international school in eSwatini, Southern Africa. It was incredible to get to know people from the whole world, and I gained a deep respect for the diversity of people and cultures that live on Earth. This is also a big reason why I joined ISFiT in the first place - I wanted a way to connect with an international community in Trondheim and Norway.\n\nWhy is polarization an important theme?\n\nIt’s evident that the world is currently facing enormous challenges. Climate change, loss of nature, resource scarcity, conflicts and war and population aging. The list goes on. We also have to come up with solutions on how to deal with the challenges that come with technology - such as job loss due to automation and the negative effects of social media and the internet. How are we going to be able to solve these issues, if the distance between us is growing? How are we going to be able to create the solutions of tomorrow, if there is no conversation? Polarization threatens our common future. Dialogue and conversations can be a part of the solution. And what better place to have that conversation than at the world’s largest international student festival?\n\nHow can ISFiT contribute to depolarization?\n\nFunnily enough, ISFiT has always focused on depolarization. The heart of ISFiT has always been to make the world a better place, by gathering students from the whole world to talk about issues that concern all of us. Through meaningful dialogue we can decrease the distance between us. It does not necessarily mean that we have to agree on everything (I don’t think that’s the goal at all), but perhaps we’ll have a better understanding of each other’s viewpoints. No matter what ISFiT’s theme has been - be it Migration, Discrimination, Corruption - ISFiT has always focused on polarization by bringing people together for meaningful dialogue about said themes.",
